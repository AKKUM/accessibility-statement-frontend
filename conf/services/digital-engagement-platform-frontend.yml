accessibilityProblems:
  - Mobile users using screen readers may find it difficult to navigate or interact with the chat window or the other content on the launch page
  - There is styling on the ‘Support for coronavirus’ digital assistant page that may make interaction difficult for users who use style overlays to make pages more readable
  - Some answers in the digital assistant that have links have ‘(opens in a new tab)’ after each link, whereas others have ‘Links will open in a new tab’ once at the start of the answer. This could be frustrating for users with assistive technologies as link behaviour may not be clear or consistent
  - Users using the JAWS screen reader may experience confusing changes in focus when being given multiple answers
  - Users using VoiceOver on iPhone and Mac and users using NVDA may experience confusing changes in focus when interacting with answers, links and new tabs
  - Users using Chrome on Android are unable to use pinch and zoom gestures once the chat window has launched
  - The button icon used to turn alerts on and off does not look different enough in its on or off state, or different enough from the print icon. It also behaves differently to the print icon. Additionally, users with assistive technologies may find it difficult to interact with the button
  - Users on smaller screens may see a menu link that does not give any interactive options
  - Some users may find it difficult to locate this accessibility statement from the footer of the service
  - On some pages, when you use keyboard tabbing to focus on a link, the colour and underline that surround the link are not bold or contrasted enough. This may make it difficult for visually impaired users to see what they’re focusing on
  - The ‘Ask HMRC’ title on the chat window lacks useful labelling for screen readers
  - Keyboard-only users may find it time-consuming to navigate back to the ‘print’, ‘close’ and ‘hide’ chat options when at the end of a chat conversation
  - Some buttons have been incorrectly labelled as banners which may make them confusing to interact with
  - If you set the font size to 200%, the text in the chat window overflows or cuts off which may make the service difficult to use for people with visual impairment
  - The ability to minimise and maximise the chat window is not announced by some screen readers, which may make interacting with the service difficult
  - When minimising the chat window, the minimised window may not be visible to some users, making it difficult to continue using the chat service
  - Some screen readers may announce the chat window content a second time after the ‘send’ button, which may make the service confusing
  - Users using VoiceOver on iPhone may not have new content announced to them when they click or type a response, which makes interacting with the service difficult
  - The icons for ‘minimise’, ‘close’, ‘print’ and ‘alert’ are lacking clear labels that would make interacting with them easier for people using voice controls
  - Some users may see a version of the chat window that has a loading animation. The animation lacks an alt tag which helps screen readers describe the animation
  - Some users may see a version of the end of chat survey that has radio buttons which may not function correctly when the user clicks them
  - Some users may see a version of the chat window that has incorrect labelling for the sound alerts button. Users with screen readers may be confused about the function of the button
